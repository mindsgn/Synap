      "transcription": "Errors in programming are universal and unavoidable in code such as in React. In the video CosdenSolutions explains that there are 2 categories of errors, those expected and those unexpected in your react applications. CosdenSolutions first explains expected errors such as validating an email and returning error messages to the end user. Next CosdenSolutions describes how a try and catch block is useful for catching unexpected issues and using the error boundaries component is useful when dealing with unexpected errors. If errors are caught in a specific section it wonâ€™t crash the entire react application."
